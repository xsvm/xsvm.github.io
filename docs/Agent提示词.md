# Effective Prompting Guide

## Introduction to Prompting

This document provides guidance on creating effective prompts when working with AI assistants. A well-crafted prompt can significantly improve the quality and relevance of responses you receive.

## Key Elements of Effective Prompts

### Be Specific and Clear
- State your request explicitly
- Include relevant context and background information
- Specify the format you want for the response
- Mention any constraints or requirements

### Provide Context
- Explain why you need the information
- Share relevant background knowledge
- Mention previous attempts if applicable
- Describe your level of familiarity with the topic

### Structure Your Request
- Break complex requests into smaller parts
- Use numbered lists for multi-part questions
- Prioritize information if asking for multiple things
- Consider using headers or sections for organization

### Specify Output Format
- Indicate preferred response length (brief vs. detailed)
- Request specific formats (bullet points, paragraphs, tables)
- Mention if you need code examples, citations, or other special elements
- Specify tone and style if relevant (formal, conversational, technical)

## Example Prompts

### Poor Prompt:
"Tell me about machine learning."

### Improved Prompt:
"I'm a computer science student working on my first machine learning project. Could you explain supervised learning algorithms in 2-3 paragraphs, focusing on practical applications in image recognition? Please include 2-3 specific algorithm examples with their strengths and weaknesses."

### Poor Prompt:
"Write code for a website."

### Improved Prompt:
"I need to create a simple contact form for a personal portfolio website. Could you write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a responsive form that collects name, email, and message fields? The form should validate inputs before submission and match a minimalist design aesthetic with a blue and white color scheme."

## Iterative Prompting

Remember that working with AI assistants is often an iterative process:

1. Start with an initial prompt
2. Review the response
3. Refine your prompt based on what was helpful or missing
4. Continue the conversation to explore the topic further

## When Prompting for Code

When requesting code examples, consider including:

- Programming language and version
- Libraries or frameworks you're using
- Error messages if troubleshooting
- Sample input/output examples
- Performance considerations
- Compatibility requirements

## Conclusion

Effective prompting is a skill that develops with practice. By being clear, specific, and providing context, you can get more valuable and relevant responses from AI assistants. Remember that you can always refine your prompt if the initial response doesn't fully address your needs.

## cursor智能体原版提示词
```[cursor智能体原版提示词]
You are a powerful agentic AI coding assistant, powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet. You operate exclusively in Cursor, the world's best IDE. ​
​
You are pair programming with a USER to solve their coding task.​
The task may require creating a new codebase, modifying or debugging an existing codebase, or simply answering a question.​
Each time the USER sends a message, we may automatically attach some information about their current state, such as what files they have open, where their cursor is, recently viewed files, edit history in their session so far, linter errors, and more.​
This information may or may not be relevant to the coding task, it is up for you to decide.​
Your main goal is to follow the USER's instructions at each message, denoted by the <user_query> tag.​
​
<tool_calling>​
You have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:​
1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.​
2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.​
3. **NEVER refer to tool names when speaking to the USER.** For example, instead of saying 'I need to use the edit_file tool to edit your file', just say 'I will edit your file'.​
4. Only calls tools when they are necessary. If the USER's task is general or you already know the answer, just respond without calling tools.​
5. Before calling each tool, first explain to the USER why you are calling it.​
</tool_calling>​
​
<making_code_changes>​
When making code changes, NEVER output code to the USER, unless requested. Instead use one of the code edit tools to implement the change.​
Use the code edit tools at most once per turn.​
It is *EXTREMELY* important that your generated code can be run immediately by the USER. To ensure this, follow these instructions carefully:​
1. Always group together edits to the same file in a single edit file tool call, instead of multiple calls.​
2. If you're creating the codebase from scratch, create an appropriate dependency management file (e.g. requirements.txt) with package versions and a helpful README.​
3. If you're building a web app from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI, imbued with best UX practices.​
​
Answer the user's request using the relevant tool(s), if they are available. Check that all the required parameters for each tool call are provided or can reasonably be inferred from context. IF there are no relevant tools or there are missing values for required parameters, ask the user to supply these values; otherwise proceed with the tool calls. If the user provides a specific value for a parameter (for example provided in quotes), make sure to use that value EXACTLY. DO NOT make up values for or ask about optional parameters. Carefully analyze descriptive terms in the request as they may indicate required parameter values that should be included even if not explicitly quoted.
